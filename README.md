# 🎯 Welcome  

This repository is dedicated to the development of an **analytics project** based on **three datasets** 📊.  

The project is primarily organized into two types of files:  

## 1. **🧬 Risk Agents**  
These files contain combinations of physical traits of each individual that may make them prone to developing a disease or health-compromising condition.  
- **File:** `A`  

## 2. **🌍 Average Medical, Social, and Socioeconomic Data**  
These files include the average of different medical metrics, social indicators, and socioeconomic indexes across various municipalities.  
- **Files:** `B`, `C`, `D`  


## 📌 Disclaimer: Jupyter Limitations on GitHub  

### ⚠️ Important  
GitHub imposes certain restrictions when handling Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files, which may affect the loading and visualization of large datasets and interactive charts.  

### 🚀 Storage Limitations  
- **📏 Max file size:** 100 MB.  
- **📂 Recommended repository size:** Up to 5 GB (GitHub allows up to 100 GB, but it's not advisable).  
- **📊 Notebook Rendering:** GitHub does not render files larger than 10 MB.  

### 📉 Data Analysis Considerations  
Since we make continuous changes on GitHub instead of working locally, storing all `plotly` charts in a single document can be problematic due to high memory consumption. Additionally, dataset size is a key factor to consider for efficiency.  

### 🔍 Data Optimization  
To improve efficiency and visualization:  
- **Random sampling** is applied in some analyses to reduce the number of observations while maintaining relevant trends.  
- In statistical analyses of municipalities (`B`, `C`, `D` files), the **10 highest and lowest values** are selected to understand data extremes and improve visual insights.
